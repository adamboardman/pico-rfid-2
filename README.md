# Raspberry Pi Pico RFID 2 Library

This library lets you use the WS18505 and MFRC522 chips via an 
i2c connection from a RPi Pico.

You can read the ID's from many cards including Credit Cards, 
Oyster Cards that support the ISO 14443A interface, it also 
supports more features including writing and key handling with
Mifare or NTAG203 cards.
